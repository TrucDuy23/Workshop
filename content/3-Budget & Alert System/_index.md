## Budget & Alert System Overview

The **Budget & Alert System** in AWS is a feature that allows users to set financial thresholds and receive notifications when their AWS spending or usage approaches or exceeds those limits.  
This system helps organizations **monitor costs in real-time**, **prevent budget overruns**, and **maintain financial control** over their cloud resources.  
With flexible alert configurations, it can track **overall costs**, **service-specific usage**, or **linked account spending**, ensuring timely responses to potential budget risks.

Key benefits:
- **Cost Control**: Avoid unexpected charges by monitoring expenses proactively.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notified via email, SNS, or integrated systems.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Set alerts based on percentage or fixed amounts.
- **Detailed Tracking**: Monitor by service, region, or linked accounts.
